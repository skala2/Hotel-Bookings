 The goal of the project is to predict the possibility of a booking cancellations and peak time of bookings of hotels in which month of the year. The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. From this, we can understand the customerâ€™s behavior and it might help us to take better decisions.  

The process of our analysis will be: Understanding the Datasets, Analyzing, and visualizing the data. 

Our goal is to predict type of customers who wants to stay either in city style or resort style and to predict the possibility of booking cancellations monthly. We also performed time series analysis to forecast the number of bookings monthly.
