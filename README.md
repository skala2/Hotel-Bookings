The goal of the project is to predict the count of booking cancellations and peak time of bookings in which month of the year. The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. From this, we can understand the customerâ€™s behavior and it might help us to take better decisions.  

The process of our analysis will be: Understanding the Datasets, Analyzing, and visualizing the data. 

Our goal is to predict type of customers who prefers to stay either in the city style or the resort style, and to predict the possibility of monthly cancellations. We also performed time series analysis to forecast the number of monthly bookings.

The data set contains 119390 rows and 32 columns.

# 5. Analyzing, and visualizing the data:

The hotel data for united states is filtered to plot the number of bookings per holidays and number of bookings per month. This visualization is plotted under Best time of Year to Book - Bookings by Holidays and Months.
